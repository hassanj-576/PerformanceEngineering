We have provided a Makefile along with the code, it works on DAS4
Now we will mention each file, what it has and how to run it

convo.c
Contains the code for convulation, the first 2 optimization have been applied
to run it

convoOpt.c
Contains the code for the fully optamize version of convulation

convoPar.c
Contains the code for parallel version of the fully optamize version of convulation


All three of them can be run in the same way, for example for convo
./convo width height kernel

Here width and height are both integer parameters and kernel is if you want to run 3 (for 3x3 kernel) and 5 (for 5x5 kernel)
So for example
./convo 1000 1000 5


Simillarly we can run convoOpt and convoPar

triangle.c
Contains the code for triangle smoothening. The first two optimization has been applied 
triangleOpt.c
Contains the code for the fully optimized version of triangle smoothening

Both can be run in the same way

./triangle width height

for example
./triangle 1000 1000


sobel.c
Contains the simple version, and first optamized version of sobel operator. 
There are two function inside sobel1 and sobel2. sobel1 is the simple version and sobel2 is the one with first optimization

sobelOpt.c
Contains the optamized version of sobel operator

There are two function inside sobelOpt1 and sobelOpt2. sobelOpt1 is the version with loop unrolling and sobelOpt2 is the one with loop unrolling and splitting the computation

To run either of the above two
use 
./sobel width height
for example
./sobel 1000 1000

By default, sobel calls the function sobel2 and sobelOpt calls sobelOpt2. to call the other function, the code has to be changed
